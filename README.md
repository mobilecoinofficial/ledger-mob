# Ledger Mobilecoin

A [MobileCoin][1] NanoApp for [Ledger][2] `nanosplus` and `nanox` devices.
You can grab the latest (unsigned) firmware and tooling [here](https://github.com/mobilecoinofficial/ledger-mob/releases), or follow the [Getting Started](#Getting-Started) instructions to build your own.

For application interaction or integration see the [library](https://mobilecoinofficial.github.io/ledger-mob/ledger_mob/index.html) and [APDU](https://mobilecoinofficial.github.io/ledger-mob/ledger_mob_apdu/index.html) documentation.

### Supported Hardware

- [x] Ledger NanoSPlus
- [ ] Ledger NanoX [#27](https://github.com/mobilecoinofficial/ledger-mob/issues/27)
- [ ] Ledger Stax [#60](https://github.com/mobilecoinofficial/ledger-mob/issues/60)

## Usage

### Attention

This repository contains pre-release and unaudited firmware releases for development and testing purposes only, use with caution.

End users should install signed and security-audited releases via [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) for use with real funds, and use a supported wallet application for building and signing transactions.


### Installing pre-built binaries

Side-loading is only supported on `nanosplus` devices with the latest firmware version and should only be used for development purposes.

- Download the latest nanosplus release [here](https://github.com/mobilecoinofficial/ledger-mob/releases/latest/download/ledger-mob-fw-nanosplus.tgz)
- `tar -xvf ledger-mob-fw-nanosplus.tgz` to extract the firmware package
- `ledgerctl install app_nanosplus.json` to install the nanoapp
  - You may need to add the `-f` argument to correctly unload prior releases


## Building and Testing

The project contains a top-level [Makefile](Makefile) exposing common functions, as well as a [`.envrc`](.envrc) file to export common environmental variables.

This repository uses submodules, clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to configure these.

### Project Layout

- [apdu](./apdu) provides APDU / protocol definitions for communication with a hardware wallet
- [core](./core) contains platform-independent hardware wallet engine, used by `fw` and `lib`
- [fw](./fw) contains ledger firmware for `nanosplus` and `nanox` targets
- [lib](./lib) provides a library for interacting with the MobileCoin NanoApp and a CLI for basic interaction.
- [tests](./tests) provides high-level functional tests, used in `core` and `lib`, as well as a CLI for manually exercising these against the simulator or a physical device.
- [vendor](./vendor) contains forked and vendored dependencies, with the intent that these will be removed as contributions are merged upstream.


### Dependencies

You will need [rust](https://rustup.rs/) (nightly), [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), and a collection of libraries / tools to build the project...

**All Platforms:**
- `rustup default nightly` to default to nightly rust toolchain
- `rustup component add rust-src` to support rust compilation out-of-tree targets
- `docker pull ghcr.io/ledgerhq/speculos` for tests using speculos in docker
- `ledgerctl` for side-loading apps to the ledger, using the github repo for `api_level` support
  - `git clone https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerctl` to fetch the latest development version
  - `cd ledgerctl && pip3 install -e .` to install


**Linux:**
- `apt install make pkg-config clang gcc-multilib gcc-arm-none-eabi protobuf-compiler protobuf-c-compiler ` for compiling and linking firmware
- `apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev lidbus-1-dev libhidapi-dev libudev-dev` for communication with physical ledger devices

To talk to the device you will also need to install the [udev rules](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules)
- `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/20-hw1.rules` to download the rules
- `sudo cp 20-hw1.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/` to move the rules to the right place
- `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules` to reload udev rules
- replug the device

**MacOS:**
- `brew install python3` to install python3
- `pip3 install flit_core` for, some reason
- `brew install --cask gcc-arm-embedded` to fetch toolchain

You will also need to make sure your python path is set up correctly for `ledgerctl` and `speculos.py` to function.

**Optional:**
- [speculos](https://speculos.ledger.com/) to run the local simulator
  - see [here](https://speculos.ledger.com/installation/build.html) for speculos-specific dependencies
  - `make speculos` to build the vendored speculos module
- `apt insall direnv` to install [direnv](https://direnv.net/) (then [set up your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)) to automatically load environmental variables
  - otherwise see [`.envrc`](.envrc) for expected environment configuration

### Building

A top level [Makefile](Makefile) exposes common functions for building / testing the project.

- `make fw` to build `nanosplus` and `nanox` firmware
- `make lib` to build the library and CLI
- `make test` to build and run all tests
- `make nanosplus-run` or `make nanox-run` to build and run the firmware under speculos
- `make nanosplus-load` to build firmware and load onto a `nanosplus` device (it is not possible to sideload onto the `nanox`)
- `make nanosplus-test` or `make nanox-test` to run integration tests via the simulator
- `make lint` to check `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` lints
- `make miri` to run miri tests over out-pointer based functions (extremely slow)  
  **This requires `cargo-nextest` as well as disabling the `blake2/simd` feature in `vendor/mobilecoin/crypto/hashes/cargo.toml`**

For more detail you might like to look at [`.github/workflows/rust.yml`](.github/workflows/rust.yml)


### Testing

Integration are build into the `lib` package, using speculos with `MODEL=nanosplus` by default.
Please note that if invoking this via `cargo test` you _must_ rebuild the relevant firmware manually.

Integration tests may also be executed against the simulator or physical device using the `ledger-mob-tests` tool.
Note that test targets _must_ be configured with the appropriate SLIP-0010/BIP-0039 mnemonic for a given test vector.

To exercise all functionality on a physical nanosplus (from the `tests` directory):

- `cargo run -- --target hid wallet-keys` to check root key derivation
- `cargo run -- --target hid subaddress-keys` to check subaddress key derivation
- `cargo run -- --target hid memo-sign` to check memo signing
- `cargo run -- --target hid tx --input vectors/tx1.json` will execute a block version 2 transaction (no summary) on the attached ledger device
- `cargo run -- --target hid tx --input vectors/tx3.json` will execute a block version >=3 transaction (with summary) on the attached ledger device

See `ledger-mob-tests --help` for more tests and configuration options.

### Troubleshooting

- `ledgerwallet.client.CommException: Exception : Invalid status 6512 (Unknown reason)` when loading app
  - your ledger device may be running old firmware, check your firmware version is `1.1.0` and update via ledger live if required
  - your ledgerctl may not support the `api_level` flag, try updating with `pip3 install ledgerwallet` or check out the development branch from https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerctl and install with `pip3 install -e .`
- MobileCoin app displays `RNG Unavailable`
  - your ledger device may be running old firmware, check your firmware version is `1.1.0` and update via ledger live if required
